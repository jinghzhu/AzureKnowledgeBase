- MSAL: Microsoft Authentication Library. It enables developers to acquire tokens from Microsoft identity platform endpoint in order to authenticate users and access secured web APIs. MSAL handles details of OAuth protocol with Microsoft Entra ID. Using MSAL, application will let users sign in with their M365 account and consent to any permissions application needs. Once theyâ€™re signed in, MSAL will provide the access token that app needs to communicate with Microsoft Graph.

- IdP: Identity provider is a system that creates, manages and stores digital identities. Entra ID is an example. The capabilities and features of identity providers can vary. The most common components are: repository of user identities; authentication system; security protocols; someone we trust.

- SSE: Azure Storage Service Encryption is performed on physical disks. If someone were to directly access physical disk, the data would be encrypted. When the data is accessed from disk, it's decrypted and loaded into memory.

- ADE: Azure Disk Encryption encrypts virtual hard disks (VHDs). If a VHD is protected with ADE, the disk image is only accessible by the VM that owns the disk.
